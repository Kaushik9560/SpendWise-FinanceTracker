# Backend-Ledger-API

SpendWise is a full-stack personal finance tracker built with a Node.js/Express API and a React dashboard. The backend uses immutable CREDIT/DEBIT ledger entries to derive balances, which makes transfers and account summaries easier to reason about than direct balance mutation.

This repository contains both parts of the project:

- `backend-ledger/` - Express, MongoDB, JWT auth, ledger logic
- `ledger-frontend/` - React, JavaScript, Vite single-page application

## Why This Project Stands Out

- Ledger-driven balances instead of storing mutable account totals
- Idempotent transfer endpoint to reduce duplicate transaction risk
- Expense tracking, category analytics, budgets, CSV export, and demo data seeding
- JWT-based auth flow with protected routes
- Verified-email signup and secure password recovery
- Password-confirmed user deletion with transactional data cleanup
- In-memory MongoDB replica set support for fast local demos

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dependencies

```powershell
cd backend-ledger
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env

cd ..\ledger-frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Recommended demo mode

The easiest way to evaluate the project is to run the backend with the bundled in-memory MongoDB replica set. That avoids any local MongoDB setup and keeps transfer endpoints working because Mongo transactions need replica set support.

Backend terminal:

```powershell
cd backend-ledger
npm run dev:memory
```

Frontend terminal:

```powershell
cd ledger-frontend
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

### 3. Optional one-command local demo

Once both folders have dependencies installed, this command starts the in-memory backend and the frontend dev server together:

```powershell
cd backend-ledger
npm run dev:full
```

## Environment

Backend `.env`:

```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/backend-ledger
JWT_SECRET=replace-with-a-long-random-secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173
COOKIE_SAME_SITE=lax
EMAIL_FROM=SpendWise <no-reply@your-domain.com>
SMTP_HOST=smtp.your-provider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-user
SMTP_PASS=your-smtp-password
```

Frontend optional `.env`:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Build Check

Frontend production build:

```powershell
cd ledger-frontend
npm run build
```

## Notes For Reviewers

- Transfer flows rely on MongoDB transactions; use `npm run dev:memory` or a replica-set-enabled MongoDB deployment when evaluating them manually.
- `Transaction` records what happened (income, expense, transfer, or reversal); `Ledger` records how money moved (credit or debit).
- Budgets are stored per user in MongoDB, so they remain available across devices.
- Deleting a financial account archives it only after its ledger balance reaches zero; its audit history remains intact.
- Email verification tokens expire after 24 hours; password-reset tokens expire after one hour. Only SHA-256 token hashes are stored.
- Password resets invalidate older sessions. User deletion requires the current password and the exact confirmation text `DELETE`.
- Deleting the user account permanently removes the user and all related SpendWise data in one MongoDB transaction.
